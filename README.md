# First-attempt-at-coding
my first webpage including animation without notes
this is my 3rd day, but instead of just going through the course and typing what the lessons were showing, I really wanted to see if i had a grasp so far 
and at least get something built, even if small
I must say, it is quite intimidating looking at a white screen and trying to get the words out to make something appear from nothing. 
what fun times are ahead!
